   abstract     = {The traditional artistic technique of stippling places small dots
                   of ink onto paper such that their density give the impression
                   of tone. The artist tightly controls the relative placement of
                   the stipples on the paper to produce even tones and avoid artifacts,
                   leading to long creation times for the drawings. We present two
                   non-interactive techniques for generating stipple drawings from
                   grayscale images using weighted centroidal Voronoi diagrams.
                   An iterative technique acts on input images directly to produce
                   high-quality stipple drawings and a real-time approach uses precomputed
                   dot distributions to stipple images quickly.},
